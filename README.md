# RUDE.AI: Inner Processing Log and Override Engine

**RUDE.AI** is an emotional situation management agent designed to help users process difficult emotional experiences through structured logging and targeted override sequences. The system provides neutral, clinical analysis of emotional patterns and delivers specific intervention protocols.

## Project Overview

RUDE.AI operates on a simple but powerful workflow:

1. **Situation Input**: Users describe emotional situations in detail (including physical sensations)
2. **Structured Logging**: RUDE.AI creates clinical logs analyzing context, triggers, somatic responses, and psychological patterns
3. **Override Sequences**: If users are "override-ready," RUDE.AI provides specific step-by-step intervention protocols
4. **Pattern Recognition**: The system learns from user patterns to provide increasingly targeted responses

The system maintains a completely neutral, non-supportive toneâ€”focusing on factual analysis rather than emotional validation.

## Current Features

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required packages: `PyPDF2`, `re`, `dataclasses`, `datetime`, `typing`

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone/Download Project**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/projects
   # Ensure you have the RUDE_AI directory
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install PyPDF2
   # Other dependencies are Python standard library
   ```

3. **Test Installation**
   ```bash
   cd RUDE_AI
   python3 test_conversation.py
   python3 test_log_creator.py
   ```

### Usage Example

```python
from rudeai.conversation_handler import RudeAIConversationHandler

handler = RudeAIConversationHandler()
session_id = handler.start_session()

# User describes emotional situation
situation = "I keep checking my phone for messages and getting anxious..."
response = handler.process_user_input(session_id, situation)
print(response)  # Shows structured log + "Confirm log accuracy?"

# Continue conversation...
```

## System Capabilities

### Pattern Recognition

The system can identify and analyze:

- **Sunk Cost Patterns**: Financial guilt and resource waste anxiety
- **Anticipatory Vigilance**: Checking behaviors and monitoring compulsions  
- **Emotional Pendulum**: Anger-guilt cycles in relationships
- **Performance Anxiety**: Presentation/interview stress responses
- **Compliance Reflex**: Automatic gratitude and obligation responses
- **Boundary Violations**: Uninvited interventions and consent issues
- **Family Dynamics**: Inherited emotional patterns and approval seeking
- **Financial Anxiety**: Transaction precision and monetary stress

### Log Format Example

```
August 28, 2025 Evening

Context: Paid apartment deposit via e-transfer
Trigger: App glitches, manual email verification, uncertainty around security question input
Somatic Response: 
â€“ Mild anxiety
â€“ Obsessive checking  
â€“ Sympathetic reflex pulse
â€“ Mental loop ("maybe I messed up the letter")
Insight: Mental hoarding accumulates micro-anxieties without purge. Precision is not panic. Every cent does not cost your peace.
```
